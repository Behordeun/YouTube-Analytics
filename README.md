# YouTube-Analytics

This project makes use of YouTube API Keys to scrape data from YouTube. The scraped data is then used for driving insights about the level of engagement and interraction between clients and brands (organizations) judging by metrics such as:
1. Number of views.
2. Number of Likes.
3. Number of Comments etc.

The python script scrapes the top 50 (arranged in descending order) videos that are being engaged by YouTubers. The data is thereafter used to build data-centric dashboards to draw more business and actionable insights from the obtained data.
